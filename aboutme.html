        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="bio"> Jeremiah is a skilled bassoonist with over 22 years of experience in the field. He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, where he developed his passion for music at a young age. After graduating from high school, he decided to pursue his dream of becoming a professional musician and enrolled in the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
        <br>
        <br>
        During his time at the conservatory, Jeremiah studied under some of the most renowned bassoonists in the country and honed his skills on the instrument. He also had the opportunity to perform with a variety of ensembles and orchestras, both in San Francisco and beyond.
        <br>
        <br>    
        After graduation, Jeremiah began his career as a professional bassoonist and quickly established himself as a sought-after performer. He has played with orchestras all over the world and has collaborated with many of the most respected musicians in the field.
        <br>
        <br>    
        Despite his success as a musician, Jeremiah has recently decided to pursue a career change and is embarking on a journey into the world of coding. He is excited to learn new skills and explore new opportunities in this exciting field.
        <br>
        <br>   
        When he's not playing the bassoon or learning to code, Jeremiah enjoys spending time with his two French bulldogs, Moo and Yakult. They love going on walks together and taking naps on the couch.</p>
